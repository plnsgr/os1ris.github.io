## Executive Summary

The dropper file exhibits malicious behavior by executing commands via `cmd.exe`, using a ping delay to time operations, and deploying a payload in a hidden manner. It connects to suspicious domains and downloads resources, likely for further infection or data theft. Additionally, it incorporates self-deletion to erase traces after execution.

## Case-Specific Requirements

### **Environment**
- **Operating System:** Windows

### **Tools Used**
- **Floss**
- **PEStudio**
- **IDA**
- **ProcMon**
- **CMDWatcher**
- **x32dbg**
- **FakeNet**
- **APIMonitor**
- **APILogger**

## Static Analysis

We used **PEStudio** to check the compile stamp, revealing it was compiled on **Sat Sep 04 18:11:12 2021 (UTC)**.

![img1](assets/5-Dropper/image69.png)

![img2](assets/5-Dropper/image70.png)

60/72 antivirus vendors flagged the program as malicious, including **Kaspersky**. The filename of the debug is listed in the Indicators section.

![img3](assets/5-Dropper/image71.png)

Next, using **Floss**, we read any strings found in the malware sample.

![img4](assets/5-Dropper/image72.png)

Multiple commands were found in the strings of the sample.

![img5](assets/5-Dropper/image73.png)

We checked the libraries that could be used.

![img6](assets/5-Dropper/image74.png)

On **IDA**, we observed the following:

![img7](assets/5-Dropper/image75.png)

The program exhibits malicious behavior by downloading a file:  
**`CR433101[.]dat[.]exe`**  

The downloaded file came from this URL:  
**`hxxp[://]ssl-6582datamanager[.]helpdeskbros[.]local/favicon[.]ico`**  

The file was saved in the public directory:  
**`C:\Users\Public\Documents`**  

The malware uses **cmd.exe** to execute the file with a delay:  
**`ping 1.1.1.1 -n 1 -w 3000`**  

![img8](assets/5-Dropper/image76.png)

The malware performs self-deletion to remove traces of the executable. If the download fails, it connects to another URL:  
**`hxxp[://]huskyhacks[.]dev`**  

It attempts to execute the file via **ShellExecuteW**. These actions highlight the malware's function as a dropper for delivering and executing payloads.

## Dynamic Analysis

Because **PEStudio** detected two libraries that load potentially malicious content, we opened **ProcMon** and filtered **WININET.dll** and **urlmon.dll**.

![img9](assets/5-Dropper/image77.png)

We checked additional actions performed by the file:

![img10](assets/5-Dropper/image78.png)

An alternative method to monitor commands was to use **CMDWatcher**, which shows all commands executed by `dropper.exe`.

![img11](assets/5-Dropper/image79.png)

We loaded **x32dbg** to view additional strings in memory and found URLs inside `dropper.exe`.

![img12](assets/5-Dropper/image80.png)

Using **FakeNet**, we monitored traffic and found similar domains while performing static analysis, such as **husky[.]dev**.

![img13](assets/5-Dropper/image81.png)

Lastly, we checked for the APIs used by the dropper. Using **APIMonitor**, we observed **URLDownloadToFileW**:

![img14](assets/5-Dropper/image82.png)

We also checked with **ApiLogger**:
