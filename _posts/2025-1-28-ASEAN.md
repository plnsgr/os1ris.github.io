## Executive Summary

The program executes "office.exe" with various command lines and parent processes from the "C:\Users\Public\Desktop" directory. It also runs "GetCurrentDeploy.dll" and writes values to the registry. While legitimate programs might use similar actions for file execution and registry updates, malicious software could also use these processes to execute harmful files or modify settings for persistence or evasion. The specific registry actions may indicate malicious behavior. Further analysis is required to assess the intent and nature of the process.

## Static Analysis

The file was first received as a Disc (.ISO). After opening the ISO, four shortcut PDFs were found:

![img1](assets/7-ASEAN/image98.png)

Checking one of the shortcut files shows the target command:

![img2](assets/7-ASEAN/image99.png)

**Target command executed:**

```C:\Windows\System32\ScriptRunner.exe -appvscript _\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\office.exe```

Upon inspecting the folder, two files were found. The `office.exe` file was not malicious when checked via hash, but the `GetCurrentDeploy.dll` is.

![img3](assets/7-ASEAN/image100.png)

Using **PEStudio** to analyze the file content:

![PEStudio Analysis](assets/7-ASEAN/image101.png)

Next, **Floss** was used to extract the content.

![Floss1](assets/7-ASEAN/image102.png)

Content inside floss:

![Floss3](assets/7-ASEAN/image104.png)

![Floss4](assets/7-ASEAN/image105.png)


The extracted functions from **IDA** were analyzed:

1. **sub_10001BD0**:

   ![Function 1](assets/7-ASEAN/image106.png)

2. **sub_10004150**:

   ![Function 2](assets/7-ASEAN/image107.png)

3. **sub_10003820**:

   ![Function 3](assets/7-ASEAN/image108.png)

## Dynamic Analysis

Using **ProcMon**, we observe the **CreateFile** and **WriteFile** actions being executed under the `Public` directory.

![D1](assets/7-ASEAN/image109.png)

Using **DiffView**, any interesting changes were monitored.

![D2](assets/7-ASEAN/image110.png)

It shows the registry entries being set for auto-execution during boot.

![D3](assets/7-ASEAN/image111.png)

To confirm file creation, the directory was checked and both `office.exe` and `GetCurrentDeploy.dll` were found present.

![D4](assets/7-ASEAN/image112.png)


Starting the **Wireshark** to see any connections was made by this malicious:

![Wireshark Connection Attempt](assets/7-ASEAN/image113.png)

Image above we get to see the `openservername[.]com` attempt to connect with the machine. The following ip also establishes as TCP to the destination of `103[.]159[.]132[.]80`:

![Wireshark Connection Attempt](assets/7-ASEAN/image114.png)

Filtering the TCP Port of 443 and get to see the ip above had a connect with the machine IP.

![Wireshark Connection Attempt](assets/7-ASEAN/image115.png)

Using Fakenet to monitor the traffic and the TCP comes from office.exe:

Checking the Relations of those ip on Virustotal have the relation with the panda malware:
